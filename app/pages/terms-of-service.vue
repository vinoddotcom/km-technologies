          Welcome to KM Software's! By accessing or using our website, services, properties, and applications, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Agreement to Terms</h2>
        <p>
          By engaging KM Software's for consulting, software engineering, mobile development, or related digital services, you confirm that you have read, understood, and agreed to these Terms. If you do not agree, you are advised not to use our services.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Services Provided</h2>
        <p>
          KM Software's provides professional software design, development, artificial intelligence implementation, and cyber-security consulting. All projects are subject to an independent Statement of Work (SOW) or Master Service Agreement (MSA) signed prior to commencement.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Intellectual Property Rights</h2>
        <p>
          Unless otherwise explicitly stated in the SOW, the intellectual property (IP), source code, and assets developed by KM Software's for custom client projects are transferred to the client upon final payment in full. Any preliminary templates, open-source libraries, or pre-existing proprietary architectures used remain the property of their respective owners.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Client Responsibilities</h2>
        <p>
          To deliver successful outcomes, clients must provide necessary assets, API keys, credentials, and feedback in a timely manner. Delays on your side may affect development timelines, and KM Software's holds no liability for milestone infractions caused by incomplete client provisions.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>
          In no event shall KM Software's, its directors, employees, or partners be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising from the use or inability to use our software products post-deployment, barring instances of gross negligence.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Service Warranties</h2>
        <p>
          We build robust, scalable architecture but cannot guarantee that all code will be eternally error-free due to the shifting nature of technology standards. We typically offer a standard post-launch bug triage duration (detailed in your MSA). Extended SLAs and maintenance must be purchased separately.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Contact Information</h2>
        <p>
          Legal inquiries, questions about MSA clauses, and questions regarding this document should be sent directly to our administrative team:
